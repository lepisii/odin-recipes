    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Choux Pastry:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, salt, and sugar. Heat over medium until the butter is melted and the mixture starts to boil.</li>
                <li>Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the pan.</li>
                <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the dough cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the dough is cool enough to touch, add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition until the dough becomes smooth and glossy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Pipe and Bake the Choux Pastry:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Transfer the dough into a piping bag fitted with a large round tip.</li>
                <li>Pipe long lines (about 4 inches) of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each éclair.</li>
                <li>Lightly moisten your finger and gently smooth any peaks on the tops of the éclairs.</li>
                <li>Bake the éclairs for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed up. Turn off the oven, leave the door slightly ajar, and let the éclairs cool inside for 10 minutes to avoid deflating.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Make the Pistachio Filling:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a food processor, pulse the pistachios until finely ground. If you want a smoother texture, you can also blend them with a bit of cream.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream, mascarpone, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Whip the cream mixture until it forms soft peaks.</li>
                <li>Fold the ground pistachios into the whipped cream mixture until well combined.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Make the Pistachio Glaze:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix the powdered sugar and pistachio paste. Add milk a little at a time until the glaze reaches a smooth, pourable consistency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the Éclairs:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the éclairs have cooled, use a small knife to cut a slit along the side of each éclair.</li>
                <li>Pipe the pistachio filling into each éclair through the slit, filling them generously.</li>
                <li>Dip the tops of the filled éclairs into the pistachio glaze, or spread the glaze on top with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Garnish with a few crushed pistachios for an extra crunch and touch of flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the glaze to set for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your homemade pistachio éclairs!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
